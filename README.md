# SpeechTextReaderJS
13/20: Speech Synthesis - 20 VanillaJS Projects


This app is a text to speech app for non-verbal people. Pre-made buttons and custom text speech. This project uses the Web Speech API.

The app will have a responsive UI from CSS grid showing picture buttons. Speaks the text when the button is clicked.  There is a drop down custom text to speech. Speaks the text typed in, and changes voices and accents.

This is the 13th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
